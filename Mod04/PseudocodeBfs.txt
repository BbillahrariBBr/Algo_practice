Pseudocode of BFS
==================
time complexity- O(V+E), if complete graph O(V+V^2) --> O(V^2)
space complexity- O(V)


Input  -> Connected Graph and a source
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal order

BFS(graph,source):

- Initiate an array Called "Visited" and an empty queue "q" -> O(1)
- mark Visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source) -> O(1)
- while the queue is  not empty: O(V+E)
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all adjacent nodes of "head":
        - if Visited[adj_node] == 0:
            - Visited[adj_node] = 1 and q.push(adj_node)
